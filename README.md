# My Code Journey

Welcome to **My Code Journey**! This repository is a meticulously organized collection of all the code I've written while learning different programming languages and technologies. It captures my evolution as a developer, from the basics to more advanced concepts.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured by programming languages and then further divided by courses. Each course has its own directory containing the exercises, projects, and relevant documentation.
