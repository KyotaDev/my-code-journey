# My Code Journey

Welcome to **My Code Journey**! This repository is a meticulously organized collection of all the code I've written while learning different programming languages and technologies. It captures my evolution as a developer, from the basics to more advanced concepts.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured by programming languages and then further divided by courses. Each course has its own directory containing the exercises, projects, and relevant documentation.


## How to Navigate

- **HTML**: Contains all the courses and exercises related to HTML.
- **Javascript**: Houses my Javascript-related learning and projects.
- **Other Languages**: Includes all other programming languages I am exploring.

Each course folder has its own `README.md` file with details about the course, including objectives, key takeaways, and specific exercises or projects.

## My Learning Journey

I started this repository to document my progress and to keep a record of all the practical exercises and projects I have worked on. Hereâ€™s a bit about the journey so far:

- **Why I Started**: My passion for technology and problem-solving led me to embark on this journey. I aim to become a well-rounded developer capable of tackling diverse challenges.
- **Goals**: Master different programming languages, understand core development principles, and apply them to real-world projects.
- **Vision**: To constantly learn, improve, and eventually contribute back to the community.
